abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) have significantly benefited from training on diverse, high-quality task-specific data. This paper presents ReverseGen, a novel approach designed to automatically generate effective training samples that expose the weaknesses of LLMs through failure-inducing exploration.'

summary: 'ICLR 2025 paper on data synthesis through failure-induced exploration.'
