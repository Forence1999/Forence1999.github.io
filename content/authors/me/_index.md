## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at The University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Chuan Wu](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~cwu/index.html) and [Prof. Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/). My research focuses on Agent, LLM Super-Alignment, and Data Synthesis.

I have published 14+ papers in top-tier conferences including NIPS2025 (Spotlight), ICLR2025, ACL2024/2025, EMNLP2025, with several submissions to ICML2026. My work spans parameter-efficient fine-tuning, multi-modal reasoning, data synthesis, and agentic systems.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am fascinated by entrepreneurship and have decided to dedicate my full efforts to it. Consequently, I have been delving into application-driven research, with a keen focus on data synthesis. Currently, I am assembling a team focused on adolescent psychological counseling. Our team firmly believes in the benevolent potential of technology and the compounding value it brings!

My [MBTI](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) personality type is INFJ-A, indicating that I am extremely open-minded, and welcome any insightful discussions and collaborative endeavors! If you share similar interests or have any inquiries, please do not hesitate to reach out! My WeChat ID is Forence1999.
